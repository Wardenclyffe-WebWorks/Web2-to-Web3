I want to create a "backend as a service" software like Directus [[1]](https://directus.io/) but for Holochain. Directus software is a classical BaaS that allows users to create content items, like Posts, Tags, Categories, and links between them. Besides the content creation, there should be a User management section, where the Roles and Permissions are made and managed. I would like those abilities but on the Holochain app. As a person who works with Web2, I think that it would be really helpful to tackle those sorts of problems and translate them into Holochain.

I feel that not much resource exists that tackle that Web2 stuff, and I would like this project would be a source base for tackling all of them. Or at the very least, write the tradeoffs and document them well.

Porting that sort of software could invite new web developers into the Holochain system, and that can only benefit us.

Goal:

The goal for this project at this very time is to open a debate and a place to talk about this idea.
